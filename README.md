## Playball!

Watch MLB games from the comfort of your own terminal

### Why?

[MLB Gameday](http://www.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/#) and [MLB.tv](http://mlb.tv) are
great, but sometimes you want to keep an eye on a game a bit more discreetly.
`playball` puts the game in a terminal window and looks like you're
tailing a log file.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g playball
```

### Run

Start it with

```
$ playball
```

You will be presented with a list of today's games. Choose one and let it roll.
